## About ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)
ZCTAs are generalized areal representations of United States Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas. They are created by the Census Bureau using Census blocks to provide statistical data and geographic boundaries for analysis and mapping.

**Important Note**: ZCTAs should not be used to determine official USPS ZIP Codes for mail delivery, as the USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Code assignments.
